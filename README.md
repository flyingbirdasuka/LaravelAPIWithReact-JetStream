This is a Laravel API project in which the front end is made with JetStream.

By using an API it makes possible to read, create, edit, delete the contents which are used in the react project. (https://github.com/flyingbirdasuka/ReactWebsiteWithLaravel)

By using JetStream it makes easier to read, create, edit, delete the data of the content and after making the change on here, the application then updates the database. Afterwards you can then see the changes immediately on the react project - it works as CMS.
